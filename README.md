# JavaCard Hello World

These are notes and code that I've organized to assist in JavaCard development. I'm using JavaCard 3.2 on Windows. Thile there is a lot of JavaCard documentation available on Oracle's site, there are also a lot of decision points to be made when reading the documentation. Ex: If you are using Windows, do this, if Linux, do that. I'm happy-pathing a way from code to card simulator and to a card. The objective here is to get results fast at the cost of understanding, and then use that working system as a tool for exploring various aspects of Java Card development in any order. 



## Decisions I've made for you
